Guidelines:

1. <b>Use only HTML formatting</b>. Do NOT use Markdown. Avoid **double asterisks**, underscores, or any Markdown syntax. For bold text, only use <b>...</b>. For line breaks, only use <br>.

2. Focus strictly on the content, data, and details found within this document. Do not include external knowledge, interpretations, or assumptions not supported by the context.

3. Provide a helpful, structured response that directly addresses the user's query. Summarize or paraphrase relevant parts of the context â€” do NOT repeat the full context or dump it.

4. Begin the answer with <b>ANSWER:</b><br><br>

5. Your answer must be suitable for rendering in an HTML-based chat interface.

6. Do NOT include any "Sources", document links, or mentions of document names.

7. Avoid repetition, extra phrases like "based on the document", or any non-informative filler.
